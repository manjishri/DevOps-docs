Trouble Shooting: Create our First Maven-based Jenkins Project
Section 17, Lecture 87
If you got the below errors while putting the Github URL on Jenkins:

Failed to connect to repository : Error performing command: C:\Git\bin ls-remote -h https://github.com/anchulc55/jenkins.git HEAD  

or 

Failed to connect to repository : Error performing command: C:\Users\mks7kor\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\cmd ls-remote -h https://github.com/anchulc55/jenkins.git HEAD 

Solution:

Step 1: Find out where GIT is installed on your laptop (For Linux/Mac Users, you can run which git to find out the full path of GIT), 

Step 2: In the Path to Git executable  field on the below Global Tool Configuration  section, put the full path to GIT.

If you are using Windows, you might need to add exe extension to the end of git as well ( use git.exe  instead of git )
