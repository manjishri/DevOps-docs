Getting Course Resources : GitHub Repo
Section 22, Lecture 122
All examples and assignment files are in a single code repository on GitHub. Each folder represents a single Section video (but not all lectures have a folder, as not all need code). 



You should clone this repo into your user profile somewhere on your host. (c:/Users/username/  on Windows and /Users/username  on Mac/Linux). Having inside your user profile will ensure Docker works correctly on Mac and Windows. The location doesn't matter for Linux hosts. git clone https://github.com/anshulc55/Docker_for_DevOps.git 

If you're rather new to GitHub, you can download the GUI to make it very easy to push/pull code at https://desktop.github.com/ for Mac and Windows. A great alternative Git client is https://www.gitkraken.com/.

We won't use git much in this course but knowing the basics of pulling code, committing code, and pushing updates could be helpful at times in the course.
